# Build and Deploy Machine Learning Model

This is a work from the home internship at SPECTRUM CET-B. They give us some tasks related to basic manipulation on data, basic visualization
graphs, data cleaning, and data modeling as well as the deployment of that model as an additional task. 

Task 1:
In this task, we are given a very basic task. We have worked on a dictionary, basic NumPy, basic graph, and some descriptive statistics.

Technology Stack used:
    Numpy
    Matplotlib

Task 2:
In this task, we are given a data set in a CSV file we have to create a data frame using pandas, add a new column which will act as a target column later on and deleting some column. Replacing all categorical variables to binary values as a machine learning algorithm cannot process categorical data values. And plotting a scatter plot as well as a box plot between the dependent and independent variable.

Technology Stack used:
    Numpy
    Matplotlib
    Pandas

Final Task:

Final Task 1:
In this task first of all we have to convert all nominal values to numerical values using "LabelEncoder" or "One hot encoder". And build an ML model using a linear regression algorithm.

Final Task 2:
Using a backward elimination method to find the most important attributes which affect our prediction from that dataset.

Technology Stack used:
    sklearn
    numpy
    Pandas
    statsmodel.api

Inferences:
The inferences that we derived from this model that 'absence', 'G1', 'G2' are the most important attributes to predict the 'final_grade'.

Future Scope:
 We can use various other algorithms like Decision Tree/ Random Forest/ SVM, etc. to get even higher accuracy with the help of these.
 We can also deploy the model in a chatbot or website or app which takes the desired input from the user and predicts the marks he/she will get. 

I have tried to deploy the model using Flask.
